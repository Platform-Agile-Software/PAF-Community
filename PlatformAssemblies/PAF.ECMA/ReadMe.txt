This directory contains the full "ECMA" CLR assemblies that originally ran on desktops
when "mono" was developed under Ximian, then Novell. It is the only version of a PAF platform
implementation that has multiple assemblies. Currently 26apr2016, it has folders for both
Windows and Mac. Whatever happens in the future with .Net core, the platforms have different
data for directories, etc. that must be maintained.
